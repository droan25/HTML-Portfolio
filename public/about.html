  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p> 
    Hi, I’m Droan Gupta, a Computer Science student at Guru Nanak Dev University, Amritsar. 
    I’m passionate about technology, coding, and building real-world projects 
    that combine creativity with logic. I enjoy exploring areas like 
    turning ideas into something practical and impactful. 
    artificial intelligence, automation, and software development - 
  </p>

  <p>
    Over the past few years, I’ve worked on several projects 
    including an AI desktop assistant, automated testing frameworks, 
    and productivity tools. Each project has helped me improve my 
    problem-solving skills and understand how technology can make everyday life easier.
  </p>

  <p> 
    Outside of coding, I love learning new concepts, experimenting 
    with new tools, and working on ideas that push me to grow as 
    both a developer and a thinker. My long-term goal is to create 
    meaningful tech solutions and eventually build something of 
    my own that helps people in a real way.
